          While working on some different projects, I was tired of just using a
          solid color or some sort of subtle gradient for my backgrounds. Or
          going through the hassle of creating some sort of image.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mr-auto">
          At the same time I was reading up on a lot of CSS Level 3 & 4
          specifications, and I thought it would be fun to build a tool that
          used some of those features.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mr-auto">
          Taking inspiration from tools like Photoshop, I wanted to leverage the
          power of the browser <i>(Chrome atleast)</i>, CSS, and HTML to create
          a simple and intuitive tool for designing backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mr-auto">
          I wanted something better, easier to use, and designed with the web in
          mind.
